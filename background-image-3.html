    <h1>Analyzing Paragraph Structure</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Sample Paragraph</h2>
    <p>The best method we have found for analyzing Paragraph<br>structure involves paying attention to levels of generality.<br> That is, a well-structured Paragraph will more always <br> have one sentence with more general subject matter than <br> all the others. Other, more specific sentences will elaborate <br> on this general statement, provide examples, qualify the <br> general point, or draw a conclusion, In turn, even more <br> specific sentences may provide further detail.</p>
