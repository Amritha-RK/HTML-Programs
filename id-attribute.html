    <h1>Flower</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <blockquote>Flower, the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As popularly used, the term “flower”
        especially applies when part or all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form petunia
        petunia Pink variegated flowers of a common garden petunia (Petunia ×atkinsiana).lilaclilac Common lilac
        (Syringa vulgaris).
        In their range of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement, flowers present a seemingly endless variety of
        combinations. They range in size from minute blossoms to giant blooms. In some plants, such as poppy, magnolia,
        tulip, and petunia, each flower is relatively large and showy and is produced singly, while in other plants,
        such as aster, snapdragon, and lilac, the individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a distinctive
        cluster known as an inflorescence. Regardless of their variety, all flowers have a uniform function, the
        reproduction of the species through the production of seed.</blockquote>

    <h2>Form and Types</h2>
    <blockquote>Basically, each flower consists of a floral axis upon which are borne the essential organs of
        reproduction (stamens and pistils) and usually accessory organs (sepals and petals); the latter may serve to
        both attract pollinating insects and protect the essential organs. The floral axis is a greatly modified stem;
        unlike vegetative stems, which bear leaves, it is usually contracted, so that the parts of the flower are
        crowded together on the stem tip, the receptacle. The flower parts are usually arrayed in whorls (or cycles) but
        may also be disposed spirally, especially if the axis is elongate. There are commonly four distinct whorls of
        flower parts: (1) an outer calyx consisting of sepals; within it lies (2) the corolla, consisting of petals; (3)
        the androecium, or group of stamens; and in the centre is (4) the gynoecium, consisting of the pistils.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote id="color">The sepals and petals together make up the perianth, or floral envelope. The sepals are
        usually greenish and often resemble reduced leaves, while the petals are usually colourful and showy. Sepals and
        petals that are indistinguishable, as in lilies and tulips, are sometimes referred to as tepals. The androecium,
        or male parts of the flower, comprise the stamens, each of which consists of a supporting filament and an
        anther, in which pollen is produced. The gynoecium, or female parts of the flower, comprises one or more
        pistils, each of which consists of an ovary, with an upright extension, the style, on the top of which rests the
        stigma, the pollen-receptive surface. The ovary encloses the ovules, or potential seeds. A pistil may be simple,
        made up of a single carpel, or ovule-bearing modified leaf; or compound, formed from several carpels joined
        together.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>A flower having sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils is complete; lacking one or more of such
        structures, it is said to be incomplete. Stamens and pistils are not present together in all flowers. When both
        are present the flower is said to be perfect, or bisexual, regardless of a lack of any other part that renders
        it incomplete (see photograph). A flower that lacks stamens is pistillate, or female, while one that lacks
        pistils is said to be staminate, or male. When the same plant bears unisexual flowers of both sexes, it is said
        to be monoecious (e.g., tuberous begonia, hazel, oak, corn); when the male and female flowers are on different
        plants, the plant is dioecious (e.g., date, holly, cottonwood, willow); when there are male, female, and
        bisexual flowers on the same plant, the plant is termed polygamous.</blockquote>
