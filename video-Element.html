    <p>Sunrise (or sunup) is the moment when the upper rim of the Sun appears on the horizon in the morning. <br>The term can also refer to the entire process of the solar disk crossing the horizon.</p>

    <p>Although the Sun appears to "rise" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the<br> Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference <br> frame;this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around<br>  the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his<br>  heliocentric model in the 16th century</p>
