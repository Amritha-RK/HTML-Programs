    <h3>Dog</h3>
    <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct
        Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be
        domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture</p>

    <h3>Cat</h3>
    <p>The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family
        Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of
        the family.</p>

    <h3>Cattle</h3>
    <p>Cattle are large, domesticated, cloven-hooved, herbivores. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily
        Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. Adult females are referred to as cows and adult males
        are referred to as bulls.</p>

    <h3>Lion</h3>
    <p>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body;
        short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male
        lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>


    <h3>Elephant</h3>
    <p>Elephantidae is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths.
        These are terrestrial large mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks. Most
        genera and species in the family are extinct. Only two genera, Loxodonta and Elephas, are living.</p>

    <h3 id="crocodile">Crocodile</h3>
    <p>Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the
        tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to
        include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family
        Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa.</p>


    <h3 id="peacock">Peacock</h3>
    <p>"Peacock" redirects here. For other uses, see Peacock (disambiguation).
        Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the
        family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl
        are referred to as peahens, although peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks."</p>

    <h3>Apple</h3>
    <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and
        are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
        ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
        Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological
        significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>

    <h3>Rose</h3>
    <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa in the family Rosaceae or the flower it
        bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
        cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with
        stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.</p>

    <h3>Book</h3>
    <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages
        (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term
        for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for
        extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a
        codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.</p>

    <h3>Tree</h3>
    <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves.
        In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth,
        plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms,
        tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.</p>

    <h3 id="water">Water</h3>
    <p>Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical
        substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in
        which it acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food, energy or
        organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and
        two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds</p>


    <h3>Camel</h3>
    <p>Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for
        passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the
        world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate
        species and is now critically endangered.</p>
