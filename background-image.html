    <h1><u>Rainforest</u></h1>

    <p>Rainforests are forests characterized by a closed and continuous tree canopy, moisture-dependent vegetation, the
        presence of epiphytes and lianas and the absence of wildfire. Rainforests can be generally classified as
        tropical rainforests or temperate rainforests, but other types have been described.
        <br>
        <br>
        Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species being indigenous to the rainforests. There may be many
        millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests. Tropical
        rainforests have been called the "jewels of the Earth" and the "world's largest pharmacy", because over one
        quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation, the resulting
        habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere.
