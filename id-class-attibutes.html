    <h1>Green Apple</h1>
    <blockquote>The Granny Smith, also known as a <i>green apple or sour apple</i>, is an apple cultivar that originated
        in Australia in 1868. It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. The
        tree is thought to be a hybrid of Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the domesticated apple Malus
        domestica as the polleniser.
        The fruit is hard, firm and with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The flavour is tart and acidic. It
        remains firm when baked, making it a popular cooking apple used in pies, where it can be sweetened. The apple
        goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe. The US Apple Association reported in 2019
        that the Granny Smith was the third most popular apple in the United States of America.</blockquote>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <blockquote>The Granny Smith cultivar originated in Eastwood, New South Wales, Australia (now a suburb of Sydney) in
        1868. Its discoverer, Maria Ann Smith (née Sherwood), had emigrated to the district from Beckley, East Sussex in
        1839 with her
        husband Thomas. They purchased a small orchard in the area in 1855–1856 and began cultivating fruit, for which
        the
        area was a well known centre in colonial Australia. Smith had eight children and was a prominent figure in the
        district,
        earning the nickname "Granny" Smith in her advanced years.he first description of the origin of the Granny Smith
        apple was not published until 1924.In that year, Farmer and
        Settler published the account of a local historian who had interviewed two men who had known Smith. One of those
        interviewed recalled that, in 1868, he (then twelve years old) and his father had been invited to Smith's farm
        to
        inspect a chance seedling that had sprung near a creek. Smith had dumped there, among the ferns, the remains of
        French
        crab-apples that had been grown in Tasmania</blockquote>
