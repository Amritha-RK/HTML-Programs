        <h1>Rain</h1>
        <p>Rain is water droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then fall under gravity. Rain is
            a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.</p>

        <p>Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation, which depends on the considered
            time. The following categories are used to classify rainfall intensity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Light rain: when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm per hour</li>
            <li>Moderate rain: when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm- 7.6 mm or 10 mm per hour</li>
            <li> Heavy rain: when the precipitation rate is > 7.6 mm per hour,or between 10 mm and 50 mm per hour</li>
            <li>Violent rain: when the precipitation rate is > 50 mm per hour</li>
        </ul>
