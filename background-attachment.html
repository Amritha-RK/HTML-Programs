    <h1>Flower</h1>
    <blockquote>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
        (plants of
        the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs sepals that enclose and
        protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce
        gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are
        enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules
        produced in the carpels.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between
        different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly
        colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they
        provide to one anotherâ€”in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of
        food.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some
        flowers may
        self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have
        mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther
        of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination
        happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen
        can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide
        nectar and pollen as food for pollinators. Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).
        After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.

    <blockquote>Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold
        cultural
        significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure, can be considered in two parts: the vegetative
        part,
        consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical
        flower
        is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle. Each
        of these
        parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a whorl. The four main whorls (starting from the base of
        the
        flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Together the calyx
        and
        corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in some cases may not be
        differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as tepals.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive
        structure in
        plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess
        of
        flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was blossom, though it now refers to flowers only of fruit
        trees.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The petals, together the corolla, are almost or completely fiberless leaf-like structures that form the
        innermost whorl
        of the perianth. They are often delicate and thin, and are usually coloured, shaped, or scented to encourage
        pollination. Although similar to leaves in shape, they are more comparable to stamens in that they form almost
        simultaneously with one another, but their subsequent growth is delayed. If the corolla is fused together it is
        called
        sympetalous.</blockquote>
